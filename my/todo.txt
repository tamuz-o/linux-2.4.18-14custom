Stuff about time: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/times.2.html

Setting policy with sched_setscheduler(pid_t pid, int policy, const struct sched_param *param)

User times are ms, kernel times are jiffies==ticks. time=ms --> time*HZ/1000 in ticks.


REMOVE FROM TESTS

finished process doesn't stay in memory forever
retain timeslice when sleeping
really can't change parameters (dont just check that it returned -1)
run in order: RT -> SHORT -> OTHER, consider prio or short prio, FIFO for SHORTs
test hw2syscalls
test get_remain after failing to set short and after short finished or is sleeping
place in queue for many processes
tests with RT processes
